# Example Conversion of Azure Firewall Policy ARM Template

The following directory contains an example of a Terraform Project for provisioning one Resource Group that contains a set of IP Groups, and one Azure Firewall Policy configured with a list of rule collection groups.

The Terraform modules for the rule collection groups of the Azure Firewall Policy are generated using the Bash script "firewall-policy-conversion.sh".

Read the [README.md](https://github.com/sitMCella/arm-template-terraform-conversion/blob/main/examples/azure_firewall_policy/terraform_project/README.md) for configuring the example Terraform project.
